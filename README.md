# A PyQt6 app for quick coordinate conversions. 

This Coordinate Conversion application offers multiple tools to convert and transform coordinate formats and projections.
Uses osgeo and PyQt6 to offer conversion from degree decimal minute to decimal degrees as well as transformations between coordinate systems using decimal degrees.

## Use info

    To keep the application small and quick, the transformations use EPSG codes to refer to spatial references. For further information on which EPSG code you need to use, refer to https://EPSG.io The dropdown menus allow for user input beyond my most commonly used 4326 (WGS84) and 26918 (NAD UTM Zone 18N).
